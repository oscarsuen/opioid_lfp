# Addicted to Dropping Out: Opiods and Labor Force Participation
Using the differential impact of the introduction of Medicare Part D as an instrument for opioid supply, we measure the causal impact of the opioid epidemic on labor force participation and other labor market outcomes.  We find that an increase of 1 standard deviation in the long-difference of opioids per capita in a commuting zone leads to a 1.4 percentage point decrease in the labor force participation rate.  There is no significant effect on incomes for the employed, but there is an increase in the percentage of people earning zero income.  Moreover, effects are stronger for men than for women, and are concentrated among those aged 25--44.  Finally, an event study suggests that effects take time to materialize.
